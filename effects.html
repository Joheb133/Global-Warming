                <p>
                Global climate change has already had observerable effects on the enviroment. 
                Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, 
                plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.
                </p>
                <p>
                Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: 
                loss of sea ive, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves. 
                This is a result of <span>global temperatures rising</span>.

                    Rising global temperatures have devastating effects. 
                    Wildfires are more common and have a greater chance of being more deadly and doing more damage. 
                    Rising sea levels will submerge some areas in water and make floods more common in affected areas.

                    <p>
                    The Earth's average temperature has increased about 1 degree Celsius during the 20th century. 
                    What's the big deal? One degrees may sound like a small amount, 
                    but it's an unusual event in our planet's recent history. Earth's climate record, preserved in tree rings, ice cores, 
                    and coral reefs, shows that the global average temperature is stable over long periods of time. 
                    Furthermore, small changes in temperature correspond to enormous changes in the environment.

                    Extreme heat and dryness are two important influencers of fire and, on both measures, 
                    2019 was remarkable for Australia. 
                    Australia experienced its hottest year on record in 2019, with average temperatures 1.52C above the 1961-1990 average. 
                    Rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere change the Earth’s radiation balance, allowing less heat to escape.

                    <p>
                    Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: 
                    the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms.
                    <br><br>
                    Global sea level has risen by about 203 millimeters since reliable record keeping began in 1880. 
                    It is projected to rise another 305 to 1219 mm by 2100.
                    <br><br>
                    In the next several decades, storm surges and high tides could combine with sea level rise and land subsidence to further increase flooding in many regions. 
                    Sea level rise will continue past 2100 because the oceans take a very long time to respond to warmer conditions at the Earth’s surface. 
                    Ocean waters will therefore continue to warm and sea level will continue to rise for many centuries at rates equal to or higher than those of the current century.

                    <p>
                    Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) everywhere are projected to become more intense, 
                    and cold waves less intense everywhere.
                    <br><br>
                    Summer temperatures are projected to continue rising, and a reduction of soil moisture, 
                    which exacerbates heat waves, is projected for much of the western and central U.S. in summer. 
                    By the end of this century, 
                    what have been once-in-20-year extreme heat days (one-day events) are projected to occur every two or three years over most of the nation.
